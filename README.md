안녕하세요, 저는 Ananya이며 제 블로그에 오신 것을 환영합니다. 나는 절반은 한국인이고 절반은 인도인입니다. 그래서이 트렌디 한 달고나 레시피를보고 만들어보기로했습니다 !!

달고나는 춥고 뜨겁게 즐길 수있는 혼합물입니다. 뜨겁거나 차가운 우유에 한 방울 떨어 뜨려 그대로 마시거나 가루처럼 섞어도됩니다.

그럼 시작합시다 !!</p>

<p>Our Dalgona mixture is ready!!</p>

<p>For winters:
Take a glass, and add some hot milk in it. If your Dalgona mixture is a little bitter, you can add 1 teaspoon of sugar in the milk itself. Top some of the mixture on top of it and your Hot Dalgona coffee is ready!!</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>You can mix the dalgona mixture in the milk, and top it with sprinkled sugar, classy chocolate syrup or sprinkles for a christmasy look!!</p>

<p><h2>VARIATIONS</h2></p>
<p>I tested a couple different variations that I thought could work and I was surprised to find that there are a lot of ways to change up the flavour!</p>

<h2> Variations..</h2>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>What is it?</th>
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mocha: </td>
    <td>Make the base recipe and then whip it up. Once you get it frothy, add in 1/2-1 tbsp of cocoa powder depending on how much of a chocolate flavour you like and whip for another minute</td>
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Matcha:</td>
    <td>You can replace the matcha with the instant coffee but note that it does not become as fluffy.   Basically, you are  making a meringue here without the almond flour. Whip up aquafaba (about 1/3 of a cup) until stiff peaks form. Then sift in 3 tbsp powdered sugar OR 2 tbsp granulated sugar, 1 tbsp matcha powder and 1/4 tsp of cream of tar tar and continue whipping until everything is incorporated.</td>
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Maple Flavoured:</td>
    <td>Substitute the sugar with the same amount of maple syrup and you get a maple flavoured whipped coffee! you will find it easier and quicker to whip up and the texture is more light and fluffy.</td>
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Chocolate</td>
    <td>The ratio for the chocolate version is 1 part cocoa powder : 1 part sugar : 1.5 parts  coconut milk. Using coconut milk here will help fluff up much better than regular milk. For example, 2 tbsp cocoa powder + 2 tbsp sugar + 4 tbsp hot milk or water. </td>
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Extracts:</td>
    <td>add 1 tsp of vanilla extract to every 2 tbsp of instant coffee. Add 1/2 tsp of hazelnut, almond, caramel or maple extract for every 2 tbsp of instant coffee.i</td>

If you have some leftover mixture, you can store it in an airtight container, in a fridge for upto 2-3 days.
